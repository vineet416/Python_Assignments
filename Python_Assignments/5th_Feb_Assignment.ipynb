    "## Q1. Explain Class and Object with respect to Object-Oriented Programming. Give a suitable example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.:- In object-oriented programming, a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects of a certain type. It defines the data and behavior of the objects, as well as the rules that govern their interactions with other objects. An object is an instance of a class that has its own data and behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take an example of a class and object to understand this better. Suppose we want to model a car in our program. We can create a class called Car that defines the attributes and methods of a car."

    "## Q2. Name the four pillars of OOPs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.:- The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) are:    \n",
    "1.Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the concept of wrapping data and methods into a single unit (i.e., a class) and controlling access to that unit through public and private access modifiers. It helps to hide the complexity of the code and prevent unauthorized access to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Inheritance: Inheritance is the concept of creating a new class from an existing class (i.e., a parent class) and inheriting the properties (i.e., attributes and methods) of the parent class. This helps to reuse code and create a hierarchy of classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Polymorphism: Polymorphism is the concept of using a single interface to represent multiple forms. It allows objects of different classes to be treated as if they were of the same class, by implementing methods with the same name and signature in different classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Abstraction: Abstraction is the concept of focusing on essential features and hiding unnecessary details. It involves creating abstract classes and interfaces that define the behavior of objects without specifying the implementation details. This helps to reduce complexity and improve maintainability."

    "## Q3. Explain why the __init__() function is used. Give a suitable example.\n",

    "\n",
    "For example, let's say we have a class called \"Person\" with two attributes, \"name\" and \"age\". We want to initialize these attributes when a new object is created from the class. We can do this using the init() function as follows:"
