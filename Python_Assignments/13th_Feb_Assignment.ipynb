    "## Q1. Explain why we have to use the Exception class while creating a Custom Exception.\n",
    "Note: Here Exception class refers to the base class for all the exceptions.    \n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.:- In Python, all exceptions are objects of classes that inherit from the Exception class. When we want to create a custom exception in our program, we need to define a new class that inherits from Exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Exception class provides the basic functionality that an exception class needs to have in order to work correctly with the Python exception handling system. It defines methods such as __str__ and __repr__ that allow us to control how the exception is printed and displayed when it is raised. It also provides a mechanism for storing and accessing additional information about the exception, such as an error message or other relevant data.\n",
    "\n",
    "By creating a new class that inherits from Exception, we can define our own custom exception with our own set of attributes and behaviors. This allows us to create exceptions that are specific to our program's needs and that provide more meaningful and informative error messages to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose we are writing a program that processes data from a file. We might define a custom exception called FileProcessingError that inherits from Exception and includes additional information about the file that caused the error:"

    "## Q6. List down some best practices for exception handling in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.:- Here are some best practices for exception handling in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use specific exception classes: When catching exceptions, use specific exception classes instead of catching the generic Exception class. This helps in better error handling and debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Handle exceptions at the appropriate level: Exceptions should be handled at the appropriate level where they occur. This ensures that the code is easier to understand, maintain, and debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use try-except-else blocks: Use try-except-else blocks to catch exceptions and handle them. The else block is executed only if no exception is raised in the try block.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use finally blocks: Use finally blocks to ensure that a piece of code is executed whether an exception occurs or not. This is useful for releasing resources, closing files, or closing database connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use custom exceptions: Use custom exceptions to provide more meaningful and descriptive error messages. This helps in better error handling and debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use logging: Use logging to record error messages, stack traces, and other relevant information. This helps in diagnosing and fixing issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Avoid bare except clauses: Avoid using bare except clauses as they catch all exceptions, including system exceptions, which may not be intended. Instead, use specific exception classes or catch system exceptions separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Raise exceptions when appropriate: Raise exceptions when appropriate to indicate that an error has occurred. This helps in better error handling and debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Keep error messages simple and clear: Keep error messages simple and clear so that users can understand what went wrong and how to fix it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use context managers: Use context managers to ensure that resources are properly managed and released. This is particularly useful for files, sockets, and database connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these best practices, you can write more robust, maintainable, and error-free Python code."
