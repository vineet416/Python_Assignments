    "## Q1. Which function is used to open a file? What are the different modes of opening a file? Explain each mode of file opening.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.:- In Python, the open() function is used to open a file. It takes two arguments: the file path and the mode in which the file should be opened.\n",
    "\n",
    "The different modes of opening a file are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1)  \"r\" (read mode): This mode is used to open a file in read-only mode. The file pointer is positioned at the beginning of the file. If the file does not exist, an error is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 2)  \"w\" (write mode): This mode is used to open a file in write mode. If the file already exists, it is truncated to zero length. If the file does not exist, a new file is created. The file pointer is positioned at the beginning of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 3)  \"a\" (append mode): This mode is used to open a file in append mode. The file pointer is positioned at the end of the file. If the file does not exist, a new file is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 4)  \"x\" (exclusive creation mode): This mode is used to open a file in exclusive creation mode. If the file already exists, an error is raised. If the file does not exist, a new file is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 5)  \"b\" (binary mode): This mode is used to open a file in binary mode. This mode should be used when working with non-text files like images, audio files, or binary data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 6)  \"t\" (text mode): This mode is used to open a file in text mode. This is the default mode when opening a file. It should be used when working with text files.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 7)  \"+\" (read and write mode): This mode is used to open a file in both read and write mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example,\n",
    "- to open a file named \"example.txt\" in read mode, the following code can be used:\n",
    "\n",
    "file = open(\"example.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "\n",
    "- To open a file in write mode, the following code can be used:\n",
    "\n",
    "file = open(\"example.txt\", \"w\")\n",
    "\n",
    "- To open a file in append mode, the following code can be used:\n",
    "\n",
    "file = open(\"example.txt\", \"a\")\n",

    "- To open a file in exclusive creation mode, the following code can be used:\n",
    "\n",
    "file = open(\"example.txt\", \"x\")\n",
    "\n",
    "- To open a binary file in read mode, the following code can be used:\n",
    "\n",
    "file = open(\"example.bin\", \"rb\")\n",
    "\n",
    "- To open a text file in read and write mode, the following code can be used:   \n",

    "## Q2. Why close() function is used? Why is it important to close a file?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.:- In Python, the close() function is used to close a file that has been opened using the open() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to close a file after using it because it releases any system resources that were associated with the file. When a file is opened, the operating system allocates some resources, such as memory and file descriptors, to the file. If a file is not closed properly, these resources may not be released immediately and can remain tied up, even if the Python program has finished executing. This can cause resource leaks and lead to problems such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Running out of system resources\n",
    "- Inability to open additional files\n",
    "- Inability to write to the file \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, it is considered a best practice to always close a file after using it. This is done using the close() function. Once a file is closed, any further attempts to read from or write to the file will raise an error.\n",
    "\n",
